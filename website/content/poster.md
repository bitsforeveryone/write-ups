## Welcome

Thanks for your interest in the USMA Cadet Competitive Cyber Team

## Poster

![poster](/img/poster.png)

Here is our team poster that you maybe saw at CYCON-US or inside of Thayer Hall.
If you recovered any flags from the poster, you can use those flags as URLs on this site
under the flags directory for more leet hacker points.

For instance if you found the flag `c3t{flag_i_found}` then you would 
go to `http://www.bitsforeveryone.com/flag/flag_i_found`
to get your prize. It is not a real flag so it does not work. Do not even try it.
