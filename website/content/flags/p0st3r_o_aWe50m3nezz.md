Whoah, first flag found. *Well done*. In cybersecurity competitions called capture-the-flag, aspring or full
fledge hackers attempt to recover strings of characters called _flags_. These flags represent critical data that
is intended to be protected by the system. It could be passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers,
or even the full schematics of a DS-1 Orbital Battle Station.

Here is your prize!
