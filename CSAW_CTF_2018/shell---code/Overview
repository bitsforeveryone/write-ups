This was the 3rd pwn challenge from CSAW 2018 worth 100 points. The idea here is to use shellcode to get /bin/sh
First calculate the offset and the jump between the linked lists then write shellcode to the linked lists and overflow the 
initials buffer in order to ret to the linked list and execute the bin/sh call.
