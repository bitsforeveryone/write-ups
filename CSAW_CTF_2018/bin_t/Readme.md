This challenge asks us to balance a tree.</br>
Once we connect to the challenge it tells us to sort the equal values into an AVL tree and gives us a series of numbers.

At first, this can be a daunting task. However, [pgrafov](https://github.com/pgrafov) has developed a great [script](https://github.com/pgrafov/python-avl-tree/blob/master/pyavltree.py) that manages sorting lists into AVL trees.</br>
With some minor modifications to his script, we are able to create our tree, keep it balanced, and send back a comma seperated list of all the values in order.</br></br>
